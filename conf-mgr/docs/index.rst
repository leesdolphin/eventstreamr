   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to PyCon Conference Manager's documentation!
====================================================

Contents:

.. toctree::
    :titlesonly:

    modules/index
    tutorials/index



.. todo::
    Patch or report an issue with the coverage module. Currently this module only produces
    :code:`.txt` files. This should be configurable so that other file types can be specified.

.. todo::
    Write or find a module that supports linking to external PyDoctor documentation. Use this to
    replace the slight hack for :code:`:twisted:`
