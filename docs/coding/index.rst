===========

I have no idea what I am doing. Please forgive any terrible code and really really hacky stuff. I'm still learning how to write python well; and how to write readable and understandable twisted code.

:code:`future`s
---------------

So right now the important :code:`from future import ...` that I have found are:

  - :code:`absolute_import` --- This makes life easy; especially inside files name :file:`collections`, :file:`string`, :file:`file`.
  - :code:`` ---
